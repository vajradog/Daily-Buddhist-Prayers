    <h3>Thank you for downloading this app</h3>
		
			The app has been designed keeping simplicity and functionality in mind. The prayers are to be recited in that order arranged in the menu. To keep the app size to a minimum, all sounds are streamed from soundcloud.com <br><br>

      We have made the audio down-loadable from soundcloud.com for free, here is the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/conserve_tibet/sets/daily-buddhist-prayers">link</a> and the entire source code of this app is also available for you to download and play with at  <a href="https://github.com/vajradog/Daily-Buddhist-Prayers">github.</a> <br><br>
      Hope you have a joyous day. <br><br>
